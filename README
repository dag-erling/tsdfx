TSD File eXchange
=================

The tsdfx utility periodically scans a list of source directories and
securely copies their contents to predefined target directories while
logging all transfers.  It is designed to implement a file lock for
firewalled environments where all transfers into or out of the "walled
garden" are logged.

The tsdfx utility was originally developed for the University of
Oslo's TSD project.

The latest version of the source code is available from Github:
