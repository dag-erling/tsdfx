.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdint.h
.In tsd/sha1.h
.Ft void
.Fn tsd_sha1_init "tsd_sha1_ctx *context"
.Ft void
.Fn tsd_sha1_update "tsd_sha1_ctx *context" "const void *data" "size_t len"
.Ft void
.Fn tsd_sha1_final "tsd_sha1_ctx *context" "uint8_t *digest"
.Ft void
.Fn tsd_sha1_complete "const void *data" "size_t len" "uint8_t *digest"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm tsd_sha1
family of functions implements the NIST SHA1 message digest algorithm
as described in FIPS 180-4.
.Pp
The
.Fn tsd_sha1_init
function initializes the context structure pointed to by
.Va context .
It is the caller's responsibility to allocate this structure.
.Pp
The
.Fn tsd_sha1_update
function hashes the next
.Va len
bytes of data pointed to by the
.Va data
pointer into the given hash context.
.Pp
The
.Fn tsd_sha1_final
function finalizes the computation and writes the resulting message
digest to the caller-provided buffer pointed to by
.Va digest ,
which must be at least
.Dv SHA1_DIGEST_LEN
bytes long.
It is the caller's responsibility to dispose of the context structure
after calling
.Fn tsd_sha1_final .
.Pp
The
.Fn tsd_sha1_complete
function is a shortcut to calling
.Fn tsd_sha1_init ,
.Fn tsd_sha1_update
and
.Fn tsd_sha1_final
when the entire message is available up front in a single contiguous
buffer.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The
.In tsd/sha1.h
header provides macros which allows these functions and the context
type to be referred to without their
.Dq Li tsd_
prefix.
.Pp
The SHA-1 message digest algorithm has been proven to be vulnerable to
collision attacks and should not be used for cryptographic purposes.
