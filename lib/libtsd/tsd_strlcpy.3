.Sh NAME
.Nm tsd_strlcpy
.Nd safely copy a string into a buffer
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libtsd
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdint.h
.In tsd/strutil.h
.Ft size_t
.Fn tsd_strlcpy "char *dst" "const char *src" "size_t size"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm tsd_strlcpy
function copies the NUL-terminated string pointed to by
.Va src
into the buffer pointed to by
.Va dst .
The
.Va size
argument specifies the total size of the buffer, including the space
required for the terminating NUL character.
If the length of the string exceeds the available space, the result is
truncated.
In all cases, the destination buffer is properly NUL-terminated.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn tsd_strlcpy
function returns the length of the original string.
If this number is equal to or greater than the value of the
.Va size
argument, the string was too long to fit in the buffer.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
If the
.Dv HAVE_STRLCPY
preprocessor macro is defined to 0 or undefined, the
.In tsd/sha1.h
header provides a
.Fn strlcpy
macro as an alias to
.Fn tsd_strlcpy .
