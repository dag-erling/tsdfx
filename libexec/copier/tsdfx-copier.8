utility copies a file or directory.
It is intended solely for internal use by the
.Xr tsdfx 8

is a directory,
.Pa dstpath
will be created as a directory with the same ownership.

in its entirety unless
.Pa dstpath
already exists and has the same size, modification time and ownership
as
.Pa srcpath .
